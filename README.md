Edited for specific use case of storing tweets in MongoDB.

## TODO
- [ ] Define a use-case: it's not very clear how we expect the user to use this program
- [ ] Define the criteria to fetch data, the number of toots we want
- [ ] Select the model to be used (baseline/pretrained) to label our data and add the labeling code in main.py (store to mongodb)
- [ ] Select the model to be used to train our labeled dataset (classification task), and the metrics (imbalanced data)
